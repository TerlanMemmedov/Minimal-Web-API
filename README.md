# Web-API
working
Nothing for now

Look for Just two sections:
   LaunchSetteings.json => Removed both "launchUrl": "swagger" lines
   Program.cs => Our whole work is inside here. We put our model, context, and all HttpRequests (Get, Post, Put) in this part. 
   The program don't use any Sql type, just inside the program With InMemory Dependency Injection (temporary memory)
   And you can control work with Postman program => body > raw > json :
                                                                 {
                                                                   "name": "Run",
                                                                   "isComplete": true
                                                                 }
